# 🧩 AI-Powered Documentation Improvement Agent

This project provides an AI-powered tool that analyzes and rewrites MoEngage documentation, making it clearer and easier to understand—especially for marketers without a technical background.

---
The system has two main components:


## 🔍 Task 1: Documentation Analyzer Agent

### 🔸 What It Does:

* **Analyzer**: Reviews MoEngage help articles for:

  * **Readability** – Uses Flesch-Kincaid, Gunning Fog, and Gemini API tone analysis.
  * **Structure** – Checks clarity of headings, lists, and paragraph flow.
  * **Completeness** – Identifies missing explanations or lack of examples.
  * **Style** – Assesses clarity, tone, and friendliness per Microsoft Style Guide.


---

## ✏️ Task 2: Documentation Revision Agent

* **Reviser**: Uses those insights from task 1 to generate improvement suggestions.
### 🔸 What It Does:

* **Rewrites Content**:

  * Simplifies complex language.
  * Uses second-person ("you") for a conversational tone.
  * Breaks down long or technical sentences.

* **Saves Output Files** in `/Output/`:

  * `analysis_report.json`
  * `revised_content.md`
  * `revised_content.txt`
  * `revision_result.json`

## ⚙️ Built With

* **Backend**: Python, Flask
* **Web Scraping**: BeautifulSoup
* **AI/LLM**: Google Gemini 1.5 Flash (via Gemini API)
* **Text Analysis**: NLTK, `textstat`
* **Frontend**: HTML, CSS (dark-themed UI)
* **Output Formats**: Markdown, plain text, JSON

---

## 🧠 Assumptions

* URLs are publicly accessible (no login, CAPTCHA).
* MoEngage documentation is consistent.
* Documentation uses standard HTML structure.
* Valid Google Gemini API key is configured.
* Output revisions are saved/displayed for user.
* Users are non-technical marketers looking for clearer, simpler content.
* Modern browser used (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).

---

## 🎨 Design Choices

* Used a modular Python backend to separate analysis, revision, and routing logic.
* Chose Flask for simplicity and quick setup of the web interface.
* Integrated Google Gemini 1.5 Flash for high-quality rewriting and tone adjustments.
* Followed the Microsoft Style Guide to guide tone and writing style
* Applied regex cleanup for output formatting (e.g., removing double punctuation, repeated headers)
* Designed a minimal, dark-themed UI to reduce visual clutter and align with tech users
* Focused on server-side processing for better control, performance, and logging

---

## 🧰 Troubleshooting

### Gemini API Errors

* Test using:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-1.5-flash:generateContent?key=your-key" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"contents":[{"parts":[{"text":"Hello"}]}]}'
```

### Output Files Missing

* Ensure `Output/` directory exists:

```bash
mkdir Output
```

* Check permissions and logs.

### Content Not Extracted Properly

* Inspect the HTML and update selectors in `fetch_article_content()`.

---


## ⚠️ Challenges Faced
*  HTML Variability: MoEngage articles use inconsistent HTML, making clean text extraction tricky.

*  Output Formatting: Needed regex cleanup to fix double periods and repeated headers in revised content.

*  Technical Content Revision: Simplifying complex docs was challenging—used a mix of custom rules and Gemini API for clarity.

*  Multi-format Saving: Outputting clean content in Markdown, TXT, and JSON required careful handling.

*  User-Friendliness: Focused on keeping the tool simple and intuitive for non-technical users.
---

## 🌟 Future Improvements

* ✅ Enable batch processing so users can analyze multiple MoEngage URLs at once.
* ✅ Add multilingual support to handle documentation in languages other than English.
* ✅ Allow users to customize output filenames or organize results by date or source.
* ✅ Improve the UI with progress indicators and better usability for non-technical users.
* ✅ Add support for switching between different LLMs like OpenAI, Gemini, or open-source models.
